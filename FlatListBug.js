This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and providing an invalid or inconsistent data structure to the `data` prop.  The `keyExtractor` prop is crucial for FlatList to efficiently render and update items. If you don't provide a `keyExtractor` function, or if the function doesn't return unique keys for each item, you might encounter this error. This can happen if your data structure changes during rendering, leading to inconsistencies in keys.
